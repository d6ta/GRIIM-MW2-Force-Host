Please report bugs here: https://github.com/josh155/MW2-Force-Host/issues
Version 1.0
First release, an updated from the previous version of the MW2 tool with new features and a better and simplified user interface.
Version 1.1
Temporarily disabled the option for Riotshields.
Fixed Countdown force host when being in an alone party
Version 1.2
Added refill stuns/flashes when you press your refill ammo key.
Made it so everyone else don't have grenades/semtexes/claymores etc...
Version 1.3
Fixed health and viewkick problem. By the way, Celeste is a prick.
Version 1.4
Removed Grenade/Semtexes/Claymores function temporarily until I fix it as it currently sometimes makes you lose your own equipment.
